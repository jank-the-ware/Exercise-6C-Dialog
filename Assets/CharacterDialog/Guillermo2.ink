Right, as the Headmaster said, key to the equipment sheds gone. Looked all around the Hayloft for it, Knob had no idea where it was. He could be lying, but I don't think he'd every willingly admit to not knowing something. I haven't seen Helena all day, so she's probably hiding out somewhere in the Graveyard. You find her, you find the key. I'll meet you by the shed.
