Another beautiful, sunny morning in the Flatrock School for Demons, Devils, and Infernals. Guess I better get used to this if I'm gonna be sticking around.
* I should head to the Crow's Nest to see the Headmaster -> nest
* I'd rather explore the Hayloft, get to know my peers -> loft

==loft==
You leave your room to get some breakfast with your new friends.
-> DONE

==nest==
You leave you room to see what the Headmaster will have you do.
->DONE
