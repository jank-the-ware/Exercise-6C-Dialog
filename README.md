# Project-06
The Flatrock School for Demons, Devils, and Infernals
# Features added
Student created models (key, beds, dumbells, punching bag, the whole environment please it took me so long)
Unique animations & models for all 5 different characters (not sure if this counts. Also 2 of the models were too big to push from GitHub, but they're seen in the video, so if you try to run it and it breaks let me know and I'll fix it)
